# fitNessMonster

fitNessMonster is a lightweight Java console app built to explore the core ideas behind a more complete fitness tracking application.  
It allows users to log workouts, manage personal settings, and store basic profile information, all while focusing on clean structure and persistent data handling.

This project is intentionally bare bones and serves as a foundation for a more fully featured fitness platform in the future.

## What fitNessMonster Does

- Allows users to log workouts as Cardio or Weights  
- Stores workout history between sessions  
- Provides customizable settings such as date format, time zone, and unit preferences  
- Supports a basic user profile with personal and goal related data  
- Persists all data locally using simple file based storage  

---

## Why This Project Exists

fitNessMonster was built as a learning and portfolio project to practice:

- Java fundamentals and object oriented design  
- Separating concerns across models, storage, and input handling  
- Persisting data between application runs  
- Designing extensible systems before adding a user interface  

Rather than focusing on visuals, the project emphasizes building a solid and reusable core that could later support a desktop or mobile application.

## Technologies Used

- Java  
- Standard Java libraries only  
- CSV and properties files for persistence  

---

## Current Limitations

- Console based interface only  
- No graphical user interface  
- No advanced analytics or progress visualization  
- File based storage instead of a database  

These limitations are intentional. The goal was to validate structure and core functionality before adding complexity.

## Future Ideas

- JavaFX or Android based interface  
- Weekly and monthly workout summaries  
- Goal progress tracking and visual reports  
- Database backed storage  
- Integration with wearable or external fitness data
